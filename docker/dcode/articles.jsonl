Red cards were shown minutes earlier for Raul Asencio and Rodrygo.\n\"This victory is historic and important,\" Mourinho said, adding of his goalkeeper: \"We knew that he could do it. You have to put the ball there, but it's an amazing goal for the guy.\"\nTrubin said it was a \"crazy moment. I'm not used to scoring. I'm 24 years old and it's the first time.\"\nMadrid fell out of the top-eight places when Sporting Lisbon got a stoppage-time goal in a 3-2 win at Athletic Bilbao.\n\"They have outplayed us,\" Real Madrid coach Álvaro Arbeloa said of Benfica. \"We've been far from the version we should be.\"\nSporting surprisingly joined Liverpool - which beat Qarabag 6-0 and got a goal from Mohamed Salah - Tottenham, Barcelona, Chelsea and Manchester City in sealing top-eight finishes. Table-topping Arsenal, which completed a perfect eight-win program beating Kairat Almaty 3-2, and second-place Bayern Munich had already advanced to the round of 16 that starts in March.\nPSG falls\nPSG and Newcastle both started in the top eight but drew 1-1 in Paris which sent both falling in the standings to 11th and 12th. The game had an explosive start when Newcastle conceded a penalty for a handball in the first minute, and Ballon d'Or winner Ousmane Dembélé's spot-kick was saved by Nick Pope.\nMadrid, PSG, Newcastle and last year's beaten finalist Inter Milan all will be in the qualifying playoffs draw Friday for teams that placed ninth through 24th.\nStill, PSG went through the playoffs round a year ago in taking the longest path possible with two extra games in February toward its first European title.\n\"We don't have to think about it too much,\" said Vitinha, who gave PSG an eighth-minute lead. \"We had the same problem last year, and then out of nowhere things changed and the ball started to go in.\"\nMourinho-Madrid again?\nThere is a 50-50 chance it will be Mourinho's Benfica against Real Madrid and Mbappé two more times next month.\nThe bracket for the playoffs means the ninth-place team, Madrid, can be drawn only against the team that placed either 23rd or 24th. That is, respectively, Bodo/Glimt or Benfica.\nIf Benfica is not paired with Madrid, then it will be the 10th-place team, Inter Milan - whom Mourinho led to the 2010 Champions League title. It is a remarkable renaissance for Mourinho, who lost his job at Fenerbahce in August for losing in the Champions League qualifying playoffs.

{"title": "Sabalenka into fourth straight Australian Open final and facing Rybakina again", "content": "MELBOURNE, JANUARY 29\nNot even a point penalty for hindrance slowed Aryna Sabalenka's run to a fourth consecutive Australian Open final.\nThe top-ranked Sabalenka overpowered Elina Svitolina 6-2, 6-3 Thursday night to move within one victory of a third Australian Open title in four years.\nA rematch of the 2023 final against Elena Rybakina was set up when the No. 5 seed ousted No. 6 Jessica Pegula 6-3, 7-6 (7) in the second semifinal.\nHer semifinal was mostly one way until Rybakina had match point. The 2022 Wimbledon champion missed three match points on Pegula's serve and then was broken twice while serving for the match.\nPegula rallied and had two set points in the tiebreaker but wasn't able to convert, and Rybakina finally clinched it 29 minutes after her first match point.\n\"Really, really stressful,\" Rybakina said. She admitted to flashbacks from the 2024 Open when she lost the longest women's tiebreaker ever at a Grand Slam to Anna Blinkova 22-20 in a three-set defeat.\n\"I'm proud no matter the situation. It got very tight, I stayed there,\" she said of the win over Pegula. \"I was fighting for each point.\"\nFor Pegula, it became a matter of swing or miss out.\n\"Sometimes when you're on the brink of losing everything you get a little clarity because you're kind of just like, 'Screw it, I'm just going to try and stay in this,'\" she said. \"I played a couple of really good points to save the match points, and, you know, she missed a couple short balls ... a couple free points to take some pressure off.\"\nAll four players reached the semifinals without dropping a set - in Australia for the first time in 56 years - and Sabalenka and Svitolina were each on 10-match winning streaks to start the season after titles in warmup events.\nSabalenka kept both of her streaks alive. As has become customary for Ukrainians against players from Russia and Belarus, there was no handshakes at the net. There was also no group photo before the match.\nSabalenka is the third woman in the Open era to reach four consecutive singles finals at the Australian Open after Evonne Goolagong Cawley and Martina Hingis.\n\"It's an incredible achievement but the job's not done yet,\" an emotional Sabalenka said in her on-court TV interview. \"I've been watching her game, (Svitolina) was playing incredible. I felt like I had to step in and put as much pressure as I could back on her. I'm glad the level was there. I think I played great tennis.\"\nThe hindrance call\nThe only hiccup was the hindrance to start the fourth game. Hindrance is called for a distraction that prevents a player from making a shot, and can include an opponent's loud noise.\nUmpire Louise Azemar Engzell deemed Sabalenka made a prolonged grunt after she shanked a forehand. The shot seemed to be going long but landed inside the baseline, giving Svitolina the chance to play on. That's when the umpire intervened.\nSabalenka asked for a video review but, after going to the tape, Azemar Engzell confirmed her decision that the grunt was more elongated than usual.\n\"That's actually never happened to me ... especially with my grunting,\" Sabalenka said. \"Then she called it, and I was, like, 'What? What is wrong with you?'\"\nSabalenka said it worked as motivation - she broke serve in that game.\n\"It actually helped me - I was more aggressive. I was not happy with the call, and it really helped me to get that game,\" Sabalenka said. She added with a laugh, \"So if she (Azemar Engzell) ever wants to do it again - like, I want to make sure that she's not afraid of it - go ahead, call it. It's going to help me.\"\nRematch\nRybakina is back into a major final for the first time since '23, and says she learned a lot from that match. She's also coming off a win over Sabalenka in the deciding match of the WTA Finals last November, when she picked up a record $5.2 million in prize money.\n\"I could take only positive from that week,\" she said. \"This is what I'm trying to do ... remembering some good stuff from this WTA Final.\"\nSvitolina's exit\nAfter reaching her first semifinal in Australia and winning a title in a warmup tournament in New Zealand, Svitolina will return to the top 10 for the first time since she took a maternity break in 2022.\nThe Auckland title was her first foray back on tour after an early end to the 2025 season for a mental health break. She said the rest and time out prolonged her career.\n\"Definitely very, very happy with the two weeks here and in New Zealand, as well, winning,\" she said. \"Gutted to not make it through tonight but it's very difficult when you're playing the world No. 1, who is really on fire.\"\n\"It was really complicated for me today,\" she added, \"but, yeah, I just want to take positives from the past weeks and just carry them through for the season.\"", "url": "https://thehimalayantimes.com/sports/sabalenka-into-fourth-straight-australian-open-final-and-facing-rybakina-again", "scraped_at": "2026-01-30T17:40:37.076375"}

The programme also featured musical performances by two Nepali students and a video screening of Holocaust survivor Mr. Dugo, who marks freedom and life by eating falafel every January 18.\nThe Embassy of Israel reaffirmed its commitment to Holocaust education and to promoting peace, tolerance and mutual respect, noting that with very few survivors remaining, preserving their testimonies is essential for future generations.", "url": "https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/israeli-embassy-in-nepal-marks-international-holocaust-remembrance-day-in-kathmandu", "scraped_at": "2026-01-30T17:40:42.922404"}

Social and civic organisations, consumer interest groups, and civil society have all contributed their suggestions in preparing it.\nThe organisations that have made such suggestions include the Federation of Non-Governmental Organisations Nepal, the Federation of Nepali Journalists, the Association of Community Radio Broadcasters, Dalit NGO Federation (DNF), the National Federation of Disabled, the Beyond Beijing Committee, the National Federation of Irrigation Water Consumers Association, Federation of Community Electricity, Federation of Drinking Water and Sanitation Consumers, and the National Federation of Indigenous and National Women's Federation Nepal, Consumer Interest Protection Forum, Youth Organization Network, Federation of Sexual and Gender Minorities, Blind Association Nepal and National Network of Women Human Rights Defenders.\nAccording to Bhattarai, the aspirations of citizens for fundamental rights, inclusive democracy, social justice, equality, good governance, and prosperity guaranteed by the 2015 Constitution of Nepal have yet to be fully implemented.\nAs a result, the citizen appeal raises serious concerns about the quality of democracy by reflecting on the current reality of not making the expected progress on issues such as strengthening democratic institutions, ensuring civil liberties, accountability of state organs, and socioeconomic transformation.\n\"Strengthening democracy, administrative restructuring, ensuring civic space, protecting human rights, good governance and controlling corruption, effective implementation of federalism, economic growth, industrialisation and commercialisation of agriculture, environmental protection, climate justice, disaster risk management, and the abolition of all forms of inequality and discrimination are now mandatory obligations,\" Bhattarai stated.\nCONSTITUTION AMENDMENT\nStating that the constitution of Nepal is a dynamic document, civil society organisations have suggested that other shortcomings ought to be strengthened while maintaining the founding principles of federal democratic republican government, inclusive democracy, fundamental rights and social justice.\n\"Civil society believes that amending the constitution is inevitable in the current context where the experience of almost a decade of implementing the constitution has exposed some structural, institutional, and governance-related weaknesses,\" the appeal letter reads.\nIn order to amend the constitution, it has also been noted that all political parties, the government, the parliament, the provincial and local levels, constitutional bodies, expert communities, and civil society should have extensive discussions.\nThe parties have been urged to issue a manifesto outlining their commitment to advancing the constitutional amendment process based on national consensus. Instead of focusing on power interests or short-term political gains, they advocate for amending the constitution to improve democracy and good governance, strengthen federalism, and address issues that directly affect citizens' lives.\nThey concluded that the electoral system outlined in the constitution has resulted in frequent government changes.\n\"We urge you to express your commitment to amend the constitution to ensure a sustainable and stable constitutional system for the operation of the government by reviewing the provisions related to the size of the parliament, vote of confidence, motion of no confidence, electoral system, and government formation,\" the statement continues, citing the detrimental effects of this trend on policy continuity, development, service delivery, and good governance. They proposed that this be reviewed, claiming that the state's financial burden has increased due to an excessive number of representatives in the House of Representatives and Provincial Assemblies.\n\"Civil society appeals to political parties to express their commitment to amend the constitution to make arrangements to reduce the number of members of the House of Representatives, to reduce the number of lawmakers in the Provincial Assemblies appropriately, and to make the constitutional guarantee of proportional and inclusive representation in the National Assembly more clear and effective,\" the letter reads.\nBOLSTER PROVINCIAL AND LOCAL LEVELS\nThe work of empowering the provinces and local levels in line with the spirit of federalism has not yet been completed as anticipated, according to civic organisations.\n\"The federal governance system has become weak due to the persistence of centralised thinking and practice,\" they state.\nPolitical parties should now implement a policy that gives the provinces constitutional authority by granting them rights, resources, and responsibilities. They believe that in order to make the federal governance system straightforward, economical, and efficient, structures with dual roles and ambiguous powers must be reviewed.\nThe citizens' appeal letter reads: 'Civic society warmly calls for amending the constitution to review and abolish the District Coordination Committee and to appropriately reduce the number of local levels and increase the number of wards.'\nIMPLEMENTATION OF FUNDAMENTAL FREEDOMS\nIn the 24-page, 13-point 'Citizens' Appeal Letter 2025', the parties are urged to clearly state when the implementation of citizens' constitutionally acquired fundamental rights will finally begin.\nIt has been emphasised that the manifestos presented by the parties at this time should address the issue of the implementation of fundamental rights, which are guaranteed to citizens by the constitution of Nepal promulgated in 2015.\nThe citizens' appeal states that the state should assume direct responsibility for basic health and education.\n\"The manifesto should include a clear policy commitment to ensure free and compulsory health and education.\"\nAdditionally, the parties have been asked to adopt a policy of progressively reducing and controlling the excessive privatisation of the health and education sectors and transforming these sectors into services focused on rights rather than profit. It has also been suggested that universities end widespread political bias and implement a policy of autonomy.\nAccording to the statement, the aspirations of inclusive democracy, social justice, equality, good governance, and prosperity have yet to be fully realised, with the implementation of fundamental rights being cited as an important factor.\nFREEDOM OF EXPRESSION MUST NOT BE HINDERED\nThrough the citizens' appeal, the parties have been made aware that the right to free speech should not be restricted.\n\"Tolerance towards criticism, dissent, caution, and alternative views should be maintained,\" reads the letter. 'Freedom of expression is the soul of liberal democracy. State entities should stop suppressing, threatening, or punishing people for exercising their right to free speech.'\nIt has been urged to declare a commitment to end excessive use of force, arbitrary arrests, and repressive practices, as well as to recognise peaceful protests, sit-ins, meetings, and protest programmes as democratic rights.\n\"Protect the rights of expression, organisation, and participation in digital media. Censorship, digital surveillance, and unnecessary restrictions ought to be eliminated. Data security, privacy, and internet freedom need to be safeguarded as fundamental rights,\" the letter reads.\nEASY ACCESS TO JUSTICE\n\"Easy and equal access to justice should be ensured,\" the appeal letter says. In order to prevent the impoverished, marginalised, and weak classes from being denied access to justice, the legal system should be made straightforward, transparent, and citizen-friendly.\nFurthermore, they have requested that human rights be upheld as every citizen's inherent, unalienable, and universal right. They contend that defending an individual's political, social, economic, and cultural rights is the state's primary duty.\nThe rights of children, women, youth, sexual and gender minorities, people with disabilities, Dalits, Madhesis, Muslims, Tharus, senior citizens, indigenous peoples, other underprivileged classes and communities, and marginalised groups should all be protected, according to civil society.\nThus, the election manifesto must include the issue of implementing special policies, budgets, and programmes.", "url": "https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/16-csos-appeals-political-parties-must-include-concerns-of-citizens-in-their-electoral-manifestos", "scraped_at": "2026-01-30T17:40:57.200315"}

Relations have deteriorated over allegations of Chinese spying in Britain, China's support for Russia in the Ukraine war and the crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong, the former British colony that was returned to China in 1997. Starmer is the first British prime minister to visit in eight years.\nXi said that \"China-U.K. relations experienced twists and turns in previous years, which was not in the interests of either country.\"\n\"In the current turbulent and ever-changing international situation ... China and the U.K. need to strengthen dialogue and cooperation to maintain world peace and stability,\" he said.\nChinese state broadcaster CCTV said Xi had stressed, without mentioning the U.S. directly, that \"major powers\" must adhere to international law or the world would regress into a \"jungle.\"\nRelationship is in 'a good place'\nStarmer's Downing Street office said Britain wanted \"a consistent, long-term, and strategic partnership that will benefit both countries.\"\nAfter the meeting, Starmer said the leaders had made \"really good progress\" on issues including slashing Chinese tariffs on Scotch whisky and introducing visa-free travel for British visitors.\n\"The relationship is in a good place, a strong place,\" the British leader said.\nXi appeared to acknowledge the criticism that Starmer has faced for reaching out to China despite national security and human rights concerns. The U.K. recently approved controversial plans for a huge Chinese Embassy in London, removing a sticking point in relations but also overriding fears that the \"mega-embassy\" would make it easier for China to conduct espionage and intimidate dissidents.\n\"Good things often come with difficulties,\" Xi said. \"As long as it is the right thing to do in accordance with the fundamental interests of the country and its people, leaders will not shy away from difficulties and will forge ahead bravely.\"\nStarmer's visit comes less than two months after a Hong Kong court convicted Jimmy Lai, a former newspaper publisher and British citizen, under a national security law that Beijing imposed on the territory after massive pro-democracy protests in 2019.\nStarmer said he raised human rights issues with Xi and the two men had a \"respectful discussion.\"\nStarmer, who was elected in July 2024, has said he will protect national security while keeping up diplomatic dialogue and economic cooperation with China. He told Xi that it has \"been far too long\" since a U.K. prime minister visited.\n\"I made a promise 18 months ago when we were elected into government, that I would make Britain face outward again,\" the leader of the center-left Labour Party said. \"Because as we all know, events abroad affect everything that happens back in our home countries, from prices on the supermarket shelves to how secure we feel.\"\nStarmer's government has struggled to deliver the economic growth it promised and ease a cost-of-living crisis for millions of households and he sees China as a potential source of growth.\nMore than 50 U.K. business executives have joined him on the trip, along with the leaders of major cultural organizations, as he seeks to expand opportunities for British companies in China and secure Chinese investment in the U.K.\nTrump tariffs spur new trade talks\nThe disruption to global trade under Trump has made expanding trade and investment more imperative for many governments. Vietnam and the European Union upgraded ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership Thursday, two days after the EU and India announced a free trade accord.\n\"At a moment when the international rules-based order is under threat from multiple sides, we need to stand side by side as reliable and predictable partners,\" European Council President Antonio Costa said in Hanoi, Vietnam.\nStarmer is the fourth leader of a U.S. ally to visit Beijing this month, following those of South Korea, Canada and Finland. The German chancellor is expected to visit next month.\nThe U.K. leader also met Thursday with Zhao Leji, the chairman of China's legislature, the National People's Congress, and Premier Li Qiang, who told Starmer his efforts to improve relations had been \"widely welcomed\" in both countries.\nThe two countries were expected to sign a number of agreements. One will try to disrupt the trade in Chinese boat engines used by smugglers to bring people across the English Channel to Britain. More than half the engines come from China, the British government said. Under the agreement, U.K law enforcement agencies will work with Chinese authorities and manufacturers to prevent engines from ending up in the hands of criminal gangs.", "url": "https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/starmer-and-xi-call-for-deeper-uk-china-ties-as-trump-shakes-up-global-relations", "scraped_at": "2026-01-30T17:40:59.708786"}

Television footage showed smoke rising from the wreckage.\nLocal media cited poor visibility as a possible cause of the crash, which is being investigated by India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.\nBaramati is an uncontrolled airfield, meaning it doesn't have a dedicated air traffic control tower, according to a statement from the Ministry of Civil Aviation. Traffic information at the airstrip is provided by instructors from nearby flying training organizations.\nThe ministry said the aircraft's crew enquired about winds and visibility with a local instructor before attempting to land.

{"title": "India and EU clinch the 'mother of all deals' in a historic free trade agreement", "content": "NEW DELHI, JANUARY 27\nIndia and the European Union reached a free trade agreement to deepen economic and strategic ties, officials said Tuesday, after nearly two decades of negotiations.\nThe accord, which the head of the EU's executive branch described as the \"mother of all deals,\" could affect as many as 2 billion people. It will likely take several months before the agreement takes effect.\nThe deal between two of the world's biggest markets comes as Washington targets both the Asian powerhouse and the EU bloc with steep import tariffs, disrupting established trade flows and pushing major economies to seek alternate partnerships.\n\"This agreement will bring major opportunities for the people of India and Europe,\" Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a virtual address to an energy conference. \"It represents 25% of the global GDP and one-third of global trade.\"\nThe accord will see free trade on almost all goods between the EU's 27 members and India, covering everything from textiles to medicines, and bringing down high import taxes for European wine and cars.\nIndia and the EU also agreed on a framework for deeper defense and security cooperation, and a separate pact aimed at easing mobility for skilled workers and students, signaling that their partnership extends beyond commerce.\nU.S. pressure propels deal\nThe negotiations for the India-EU deal got a new impetus after U.S. President Donald Trump's strong-arm trade tactics, including threatening his European allies with punitive tariffs over their objections to Trump's threats to take control of Greenland.\nModi, speaking at a joint news conference in New Delhi with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President António Costa, said that the partnership with the EU \"will strengthen stability in the international system\" at a time of \"turmoil in the global order.\"\n\"Europe and India are making history today. We have concluded the mother of all deals,\" von der Leyen posted on X.\nIn a speech later, she said that the accord was a tale of \"two giants\" who chose partnership \"in a true win-win fashion.\" She also said that it sends \"a strong message that cooperation is the best answer to global challenges.\"\nThe deal is expected to further integrate supply chains and strengthen joint manufacturing power between the two economies. It will also cut up to 4 billion euros ($4.7 billion) in annual tariffs for exporters and create jobs for millions of workers in India and Europe.\nEasing regulation\nA formal signing of the deal could come later this year after officials go through the legal details of the text and the European Parliament ratifies it. India's trade minister, Piyush Goyal, said that he expected the deal to take effect by the end of the year.\nIndia is expected to reduce or eliminate tariffs for 96.6% of EU exports, while Brussels will reciprocate with similar reductions in phases that eventually cover nearly 99% of India's shipments by trade value, according to statements from both sides.\nIndia's sectors poised to gain from the deal include textiles, apparel, engineering goods, and leather, handicraft, footwear and marine products, while the EU's gains will be in wine, automobiles, chemicals and pharmaceuticals, among others.\nA quota system for automobiles, wines and whisky has been agreed upon, bringing down steep duties.\nThe European Commission said that tariffs charged by India on EU-made cars will gradually go down from 110% to as low as 10%, while they will be fully abolished for car parts after five to 10 years. Tariffs ranging up to 44% on machinery, 22% on chemicals and 11% on pharmaceuticals will also be mostly eliminated.\nOn European wine, the tariffs in India would come down from 150% to 20% for premium wines.\nNew Delhi has excluded dairy products such as milk and cheese from the deal, along with cereals, citing \"domestic sensitivities\" about those products. For its part, the EU won't allow concessional tariffs on imports of Indian sugar, meat, poultry and beef products, Indian Trade Ministry officials said.\nOffsetting U.S. tariffs impact\nIndia is looking to diversify its export destinations as part of a strategy to offset the impact of higher U.S. tariffs, including an extra 25% levy on Indian goods for its unabated purchases of discounted Russian oil, bringing the combined tariffs imposed by the United States on its Asian ally to 50%.\nFor the EU, the deal offers the bloc expanded access to one of the world's fastest-growing major economies, and helps European exporters and investors reduce their reliance on more volatile markets.\n\"This is the most comprehensive trade deal India has ever signed, which gives European companies a first mover advantage into this market and gives them a strategic upper hand that other players do not,\" said Garima Mohan, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund.\nTrade between India and EU stood at $136.5 billion in 2024 to 2025. The two sides hope to increase that to about $200 billion by 2030, Indian officials said.\n\"Ultimately, the agreement is about creating a stable commercial corridor between two major markets at a time the global trading system is fragmenting,\" Indian trade analyst Ajay Srivastava said.\nThe EU is still reeling from the aggressive approach of its once-stalwart ally across the Atlantic. There's a widespread sense of betrayal across the bloc from Trump's onslaught of higher tariffs, embrace of far-right parties and belligerence over Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of EU member Denmark.\nBrussels has accelerated its outreach to markets around the world. Over the past year, von der Leyen has signed deals with Japan, Indonesia, Mexico and South America under the catchphrase \"strategic autonomy,\" which in practice is akin to decoupling from a U.S. seen by most European leaders as erratic.", "url": "https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/india-and-eu-clinch-the-mother-of-all-deals-in-a-historic-free-trade-agreement", "scraped_at": "2026-01-30T17:41:04.204122"}

The Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party have historically dominated the country's electorate.\nThere are also concerns about the country's law and order situation, but the government says they will keep the voting peaceful.\nYunus assumed office three days after Hasina left the country for India on Aug. 5, 2024, following the deaths of hundreds of protesters and others in a violent crackdown.\nWith the Awami League excluded from the election, a 10-party alliance led by Jamaat-e-Islami, an Islamist party, is seeking to expand its influence. Jamaat-e-Islami has long faced criticism from secular groups who say its positions challenge Bangladesh's secular foundations. A new party formed by student leaders of the uprising, the National Citizen Party, or NCP, is also part of the alliance.\nTarique Rahman, BNP chairman and the son of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, is widely seen as a leading contender for prime minister. His party has drawn strong support rooted in the political legacy of his mother, who died last month. Rahman returned to Bangladesh last month after 17 years in exile in the United Kingdom.\nRahman launched his campaign in the northeastern city of Sylhet with an address to thousands of supporters at a rally Thursday. He is scheduled to visit several other districts in the coming days.\nIn Sylhet, Rahman criticized the Jamaat-e-Islami party for using religious sentiment to get votes. He said that if elected, he would uphold national sovereignty and work for women and young people.\n\"Now we must establish the right to vote, rebuild the nation, and make it economically self-reliant,\" he said.\nJamaat-e-Islami and the NCP began their campaigns in the capital, Dhaka.\n\"There are terrorism (crimes), extortion, corruption and forcible possession, (our fight) is against them to establish a just Bangladesh, and alongside to build a safe Dhaka for women and children,\" said Nasiruddin Patwari, a leader of the National Citizen Party.\nThe election will also include a referendum on a national charter, with the interim government seeking voter support for what it describes as a new political course built on reforms. The charter was signed last year by 25 of the country's 52 registered political parties. The Awami League opposed the idea and several other parties declined to sign the document.\nRahman's return has reenergized his supporters.\n\"Under his leadership, in the coming time we want to see a self-reliant Bangladesh and organizing this country through a democratic process,\" said Ali Akbar Rajan, a BNP supporter, at Rahman's rally in Sylhet. \"He will emerge as a successful statesman, that is what we hope for,\"\nThe July National Charter, named after the uprising that began in July 2024 and led to the fall of Hasina, is currently nonbinding. Supporters of the charter say a referendum is needed to make it legally binding and a part of the constitution.

{"title": "Denmark says its sovereignty is not negotiable after Trump's Greenland about-turn", "content": "COPENHAGEN, JANUARY 22\nDenmark's prime minister insisted that her country can't negotiate on its sovereignty on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he agreed on a \"framework of a future deal\" on Arctic security with the head of NATO. Trump said the outcome would be \"all the military access we want\" to Greenland.\nTrump on Wednesday abruptly scrapped the tariffs he had threatened to impose on eight European nations to press for U.S. control over Greenland, a semiautonomous territory of NATO ally Denmark. It was a dramatic reversal hours after he insisted he wanted to get the island \"including right, title and ownership\" - though he also said he would not use force.\nMuch about the potential deal remained unclear on Thursday, though Trump said in a Fox Business interview that \"we're going to have total access to Greenland.\"\n\"We're going to have all the military access we want,\" he added.\nTrump said the deal, if completed, will also allow for the United States to install an element of his \"Golden Dome,\" part of a multibillion dollar missile defense system, in Greenland.\nDenmark insists on territorial integrity\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said security in the Arctic is a matter for all of NATO, and it is \"good and natural\" that it be discussed between the U.S. president and Rutte. She said in a statement that she had spoken with Rutte \"on an ongoing basis,\" including before and after he met Trump in Davos.\nShe wrote that NATO is fully aware of the kingdom of Denmark's position that anything political can be negotiated on, including security, investment and economic issues - \"but we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty.\"\n\"I have been informed that this has not been the case,\" she said, adding that only Denmark and Greenland can make decisions on issues concerning Denmark and Greenland.\nFrederiksen said that Denmark wants to continue engaging in constructive dialogue with allies on how to strengthen security in the Arctic, including the U.S. Golden Dome program, \"provided that this is done with respect for our territorial integrity.\"\nDenmark has said the U.S., which already has a military presence, can boost its bases on Greenland. The U.S. is already party to a 1951 treaty that gives it broad rights to set up military bases there with the consent of Denmark and Greenland.\nNATO spokesperson Allison Hart said the alliance's secretary general, Mark Rutte, \"did not propose any compromise to sovereignty during his meeting with President Trump.\" She said that negotiations between Denmark, Greenland and the U.S. \"will go forward aimed at ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold - economically or militarily - in Greenland.\"\nChristan Friis Bach, the chair of the Danish parliament's foreign policy committee, told The Associated Press that Denmark wants to see a \"consolidated and permanent\" NATO surveillance and security mission in the Arctic, along the lines of the Baltic Sentry mission the alliance launched in the Baltic Sea last year.\nWelcome and skepticism for Trump's switch\nOn the streets of Copenhagen, some were skeptical about Trump's switch.\n\"I think the man has said many things and done a lot of different things to what he says,\" said Louise Pedersen, 22, who works with a startup company. \"I have a hard time believing it. I think it's terrifying that we stand here in 2026.\"\nShe said it's for Greenlanders to decide what happens with their land - \"not Donald Trump.\"\n\"I don't really trust anything Mr. Trump is saying,\" said Poul Bjoern Strand, 70, an advertising worker.\nOn the possibility of ceding territory, he said: \"That's not what the Greenlanders want, that's not what the Danish people want, and ... I cannot believe that Danes are going to follow that.\"\nChancellor Friedrich Merz of Germany, one of the European countries that had faced Trump's threat of tariffs over Greenland, underlined the need for European NATO allies to do more to secure the Arctic region and stressed that it is \"a common trans-Atlantic interest.\"\n\"We will protect Denmark, Greenland, the north from the threat posed by Russia,\" he said at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, Switzerland. \"We will uphold the principles on which the trans-Atlantic partnership is founded, namely sovereignty and territorial integrity.\"\n\"We support talks between Denmark, Greenland (and) the United States on the basis of these principles,\" aiming for closer cooperation, Merz said. \"It is good news that we are making steps into that right direction. I welcome President Trump's remarks from last night - this is the right way to go.\"\nFrederiksen traveled to the United Kingdom on Thursday for talks with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who said the pair would discuss how to \"take the vital steps\" towards security in the Arctic as he credited Trump's \"pragmatism\" for withdrawing his tariff threats.", "url": "https://thehimalayantimes.com/world/denmark-says-its-sovereignty-is-not-negotiable-after-trumps-greenland-about-turn", "scraped_at": "2026-01-30T17:41:09.042553"}

Nine others were injured in attacks in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih and in the front-line Zaporizhzhia region.\nThe CSIS report said Russia suffered 1.2 million casualties, including up to 325,000 troop deaths, between February 2022 and December 2025.\n\"Despite claims of battlefield momentum in Ukraine, the data shows that Russia is paying an extraordinary price for minimal gains and is in decline as a major power,\" the report said. \"No major power has suffered anywhere near these numbers of casualties or fatalities in any war since World War II.\"\nIt estimated that Ukraine, with its smaller army and population, had suffered between 500,000 to 600,000 military casualties, including up to 140,000 deaths.\nNeither Moscow nor Kyiv gives timely data on military losses, and each side seeks to amplify the other side's casualties.\nCommenting on the report, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that the research could not be considered \"reliable information\" and that only Russia's Ministry of Defense was authorized to provide information on military losses.\nThe ministry has not released figures on battlefield deaths since a statement in September 2022 that said just under 6,000 Russian soldiers had been killed.\nThe Ukrainian government had no immediate comment on the report. In an interview with NBC in February 2025, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that more than 46,000 Ukrainian soldiers had been killed since the war began.\nThe CSIS report estimated that at current rates, combined Russian and Ukrainian casualties may be as high as 1.8 million and could reach 2 million by spring.\nThe figures from the CSIS were compiled using the Washington-based think tank's own analysis, data published by independent Russian news site Mediazona with the BBC, estimates by the British government and interviews with state officials.\nA war of attrition\nReports about military losses have been repressed in Russian media, activists and independent journalists say.\nMediazona, together with the BBC and a team of volunteers, has so far collected the names of more than 160,000 troops killed by scouring news reports, social media and government websites.\nThe report also said Russian forces were advancing at a sluggish pace since they seized the initiative on the battlefield in 2024, despite their much larger size.\nRussia's advance in Ukraine has largely settled into a grinding war of attrition, and analysts say Russian President Vladimir Putin is in no rush to find a settlement, despite his army's difficulties on the roughly 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line.\nThe report said Russian forces have advanced at an average rate of between 15 and 70 meters (49 to 230 feet) per day in their most prominent offensives.\nThat is \"slower than almost any major offensive campaign in any war in the last century,\" the report said.\nPutin told his annual news conference last month that 700,000 Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine. He gave the same number in 2024, and a slightly lower figure - 617,000 - in December 2023. It was not possible to verify those figures.\n2 killed in attack in Kyiv region\nOfficials said Wednesday that two people were killed near the Ukrainian capital and at least nine others were injured in attacks across Ukraine.\nA man and a woman died in an overnight attack in the Bilohorodka area on the outskirts of Kyiv, according to Mykola Kalashnyk, head of the regional military administration.\nOfficials in the Ukrainian cities of Odesa and Kryvyi Rih, as well as the Zaporizhzhia region, also reported Russian strikes overnight, wounding at least nine people and damaging infrastructure.\nUkraine's air force said that Russia attacked overnight with one ballistic missile and 146 strike drones, 103 of which were shot down or destroyed using electronic warfare.\nMeanwhile, Russia's Ministry of Defense said its air defenses destroyed 75 Ukrainian drones overnight.

{"title": "Toastmasters Leadership Institute 2026: Building stronger clubs-and stronger organizations-through leadership and membership excellence", "content": "The Toastmasters Leadership Institute (TLI), organized by Division A and Division B of Toastmasters District 41, was successfully conducted on January 17, 2026, at Sanskriti International School, Kathmandu. The program brought together the spirit of leadership, learning, and collaboration. With over 100 Toastmasters members in attendance, it became one of the most impactful and resplendent leadership training events of the season in Nepal.\nTLI is one of the core training platforms in Toastmasters. While it is designed primarily to equip club officers and members with the knowledge, skills, and mindset needed to lead Toastmasters clubs more effectively, the principles explored during TLI extend far beyond club leadership. The competencies developed-such as goal setting, team management, communication, accountability, and stakeholder engagement-are equally relevant in organizational leadership contexts across government, private sector, and development organizations.\nThis edition of TLI reflected that broader relevance, with a strong focus on practical leadership, systems thinking, people management, and long-term growth-areas that resonate with anyone holding leadership or coordination responsibilities in professional settings.\n\n\nThe training included dedicated sessions for each club officer role, facilitated by experienced and committed Toastmasters leaders. The trainers for the respective roles were:\nPresident Trainer: Vaishali Pradhan\nVice President Education Trainer: Grishma Shrestha\nVice President Membership Trainer: Susan Dangol\nVice President Public Relations Trainer: Amod Niraula\nSecretary Trainer: Prajwol Tamrakar 'Nepal'\nTreasurer Trainer: Rajan Maharjan\nSergeant at Arms Trainer: Kajol Jha\nIn addition, special sessions were conducted by Toastmasters Nirajan Shrestha and Anuj Shrestha on Awards and DCP (Distinguished Club Program) Goals and the Dashboard respectively. These sessions emphasized performance tracking, goal alignment, and data-informed decision-making-skills that are increasingly critical in modern organizations as well.\n\n\nEach session was interactive and practical in nature. Participants gained a clearer understanding of their roles, learned best practices, and shared real-life experiences from their own clubs. This peer-learning environment mirrored the dynamics of effective workplaces, where learning happens not only through formal training but also through shared reflection and collaboration.\nOne of the major highlights of the program was the Membership Building session conducted by Distinguished Toastmaster Ranjit Acharya. His session focused on how clubs can increase membership while simultaneously building stronger and more sustainable systems. The ideas presented had strong parallels with organizational growth and team-building strategies, emphasizing mindset, visibility, engagement, and relationship management.\nUsing practical frameworks and relatable examples, he spoke about creating visibility through social media, strengthening public relations, enhancing guest and stakeholder engagement, and establishing effective follow-up systems. He also highlighted approaches such as showcasing member achievements, organizing open-to-guest meetings, leveraging word-of-mouth referrals, and building partnerships with corporate, community, and institutional platforms. These strategies resonated deeply with participants, as they reflected challenges commonly faced by teams and organizations seeking growth and relevance.\nThe venue, Sanskriti International School, provided a resplendent learning environment that supported discussions, networking, and engagement throughout the day. The energy in the hall reflected the shared commitment of Toastmasters in Nepal to grow together-not only as club leaders but also as professionals striving to lead better in their respective organizations.\n\n\nOverall, TLI 2026 organized by Division A and Division B served as a strong reminder that effective leadership-whether in a Toastmasters club or an organization-is built on prepared leaders, clear systems, and a growth-focused mindset. The program not only trained club officers but also empowered participants with leadership insights applicable to their workplaces and communities.\nContinuing this momentum, the next Toastmasters Leadership Institute organized by Division C and Division D is scheduled for January 31, 2026. The Toastmasters community is equally excited and eagerly looking forward to this upcoming program.\nAs Toastmasters in Nepal continue their journey of communication and leadership excellence, programs like TLI play a vital role in shaping leaders who create impact-not only within their clubs, but also across organizations, institutions, and society at large.", "url": "https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/toastmasters-leadership-institute-2026-building-stronger-clubs-and-stronger-organizations-through-leadership-and-membership-excellence", "scraped_at": "2026-01-30T17:41:29.927728"}
{"title": "My Peace Corps experience", "content": "Being born in Nepal and moving to the United States at the age of five, my parents never allowed me to forget our culture, heritage, or motherland. From a young age, they taught me that helping others and giving back as much as possible is the best way to live life-a lesson that continues to guide me today. Yo maan ta mero Nepali ho-six simple words meaning \"My heart is Nepali\"-captures my enduring love for Nepal. Even as a child, I carried a deep desire to one day return and create a meaningful impact in the country where my life began.\nAfter moving to the United States, my family first lived in Maryland for about a year and a half. While there was a Nepali community, my involvement was limited due to my young age. Eventually, we moved to North Carolina, where we were warmly welcomed into a close-knit Nepali community. The Nepal Center of North Carolina (NCNC) became my first real experience of what it meant to belong to a community built on shared identity, service, and care for one another.\nSoon after settling in North Carolina, I began volunteering at NCNC. My family and I attended nearly every event, and I helped wherever I could-setting up, breaking down, and assisting with whatever was needed. Over time, I built deep connections within the community and met people who would profoundly influence my life. It was through NCNC that I was first introduced to the Peace Corps. A respected community member, who had served as a Peace Corps volunteer in Nepal during the 1980s, shared stories of his time working in Nepali villages. I listened with fascination. Every conversation planted a seed, and Peace Corps slowly became something I saw not just as an opportunity, but as a calling.\nWhile in high school, I started my own electronics repair business from home, focusing on computers, laptops, and mobile phones. Through hands-on experience, I developed strong troubleshooting skills and learned both hardware and software systems. As my business grew, I began purchasing broken devices, repairing them, and reselling them. More than just technical skills, this experience taught me patience, problem-solving, and how to work independently-skills I now use daily in my service in Nepal.\nAfter graduating from Lenoir-Rhyne University in 2022, I worked as a Technical Support Specialist and later as a Software Engineer.\nAlthough these roles were professionally rewarding, I felt something was missing. I wanted to do work that felt meaningful. I wanted to do work that directly impacted people's lives. That longing brought me back to Peace Corps and to the idea of returning to Nepal, not as a visitor, but as a volunteer.\nInitially, I explored English Education opportunities but later learned about a Peace Corps Response position as a Digital Learning Trainer, which is a six-month assignment focused on teaching computer science and repairing computers. This role perfectly aligned with my skills and my desire to serve. In November 2024, while visiting Nepal for my cousin's wedding, I met with Peace Corps Nepal staff and the Country Director to learn more. After this, I submitted my application. In April 2025, I received the news that I had been accepted.\nIt was a moment of overwhelming joy. Serving in Nepal through Peace Corps was not just a dream fulfilled-it felt like destiny.\nI arrived in Nepal in May 2025 as part of Nepal Response 2, alongside seven other volunteers. After two weeks of technical, medical, and language training, we were placed across different districts. I was assigned to the Kaski District, where I now work at a government school. Each day begins with morning assembly, followed by teaching or co-teaching computer classes for grades five, eight, nine, and ten.\nMy teaching varies by grade level. Fifth graders learn the basics-what a computer is and what its parts do. Eighth graders go deeper, studying the history of computers, Microsoft Office, introductory HTML, and QBASIC. Ninth grade begins with fundamentals before moving into block programming, web technologies, internet and social media, cybersecurity, and more advanced HTML. Tenth grade brings everything together: networking, ethics, computer security, contemporary technologies, number systems, database management systems, modular programming, C programming, and QBASIC. Most days are long but incredibly fulfilling.\nOne experience that deeply impacted me emotionally was our school's pen pal program. The goal was simple: help students practice reading and writing English by exchanging letters with students in the United States. However, I quickly realized how difficult this was for many of my students. Even letters written in basic English were hard for them to understand. When my students replied, many letters looked the same-one student would write, and the rest would copy. This moment made me realize just how challenging English is for them, and how much support they truly need. It also showed me the limits of what I can do within a short time frame, which has been humbling and emotionally difficult.\nAs my service progressed, it became clear to me that six months was simply not enough time to create the kind of sustainable impact this community deserved. Meaningful change-especially in education and technology-requires trust, consistency, and time. While I was able to make progress in the classroom and improve the school's computer labs, I realized that real growth happens gradually.\nStudents need repeated exposure, teachers need long-term support, and systems need time to take root. With that understanding, I made the decision to extend my Peace Corps service from six months to a full 27 months. This decision was not easy, especially knowing it meant spending more time away from my family, but it felt necessary. Extending my service was my way of committing more deeply-to the students, the school, and the community that had welcomed me so warmly. I wanted to ensure that the work I started would continue to grow long after my service ends.\nOne of the hardest parts of my service has been being away from my parents. I had never gone more than a month without seeing them before coming to Nepal, and the distance has been challenging. We talk every day, which helps, but the separation has taught me independence and emotional resilience.\nI live with a host family, and living in the community has been one of the most transformative parts of my service. Life here is simple, but deeply connected. Everyone knows everyone. People genuinely care for one another. This level of community integration is something I had never experienced before, even during short visits to Nepal.\nServing in Nepal as someone born here but raised in the United States has been both an honor and a challenge. Many people treat me differently than they would an American volunteer. Some welcome me warmly, appreciating that I returned to serve. Others question why I am here at all. Through this experience, I've learned that my identity is not just my own-it belongs to the community as well. This has reshaped how I understand what it means to be Nepali.\nOne tangible impact of my service has been improving the school's computer labs. During the Ashad break, my counterpart teachers and I worked to repair computers, replace parts, and restore functionality. Today, most of our computers are working, with only about fourteen non-functional machines remaining. For me, success means having two fully functional computer labs that can serve students long after my service ends.\nBy the end of my service, I hope the community clearly sees the value of having a volunteer-not just in terms of technical skills, but in presence, collaboration, and support. This experience has strongly shaped my future goals. I aspire to become a Foreign Service Officer, continuing to work with Nepal and representing communities like the one I now serve.\nTo the Nepal Center of North Carolina, I offer my deepest gratitude. Thank you for shaping me into someone who believes in service and community. Without NCNC, I may never have found the motivation to return to Nepal and serve. The NCNC community played a critical role in guiding me toward this path, and I know I made the right decision.\nTo young Nepali-Americans, I encourage you to experience service firsthand. We are incredibly privileged to grow up in the United States, surrounded by resources and opportunities. But to truly understand Nepal-to understand daily life, challenges, and resilience-you must live it, not just visit it. Only through prolonged engagement can you fully appreciate what it means to give back.\nPeace Corps has allowed me to reconnect with my roots in a way that is humbling and transformative. Giving back is not a single act-it is a lifelong commitment. One that began with my parents' teachings, was nurtured by the Nepali community in North Carolina, and now continues here, in Nepal, where my heart has always belonged.\nDulal served as Peace Corps Response Volunteer", "url": "https://thehimalayantimes.com/lifestyle/my-peace-corps-experience", "scraped_at": "2026-01-30T17:41:32.728673"}

{"title": "Social media platforms removed 4.7 million accounts after Australia banned them for children", "content": "WELLINGTON,JANUARY 16\nSocial media companies have revoked access to about 4.7 million accounts identified as belonging to children in Australia since the country banned use of the platforms by those under 16, officials said.\n\"We stared down everybody who said it couldn't be done, some of the most powerful and rich companies in the world and their supporters,\" communications minister Anika Wells told reporters on Friday. \"Now Australian parents can be confident that their kids can have their childhoods back.\"\nThe figures, reported to Australia's government by 10 social media platforms, were the first to show the scale of the landmark ban since it was enacted in December over fears about the effects of harmful online environments on young people. The law provoked fraught debates in Australia about technology use, privacy, child safety and mental health and has prompted other countries to consider similar measures.\nOfficials said the figure was encouraging\nUnder Australian law, Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, YouTube and Twitch face fines of up to 49.5 million Australian dollars ($33.2 million) if they fail to take reasonable steps to remove the accounts of Australian children younger than 16. Messaging services such as WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger are exempt.\nTo verify age, platforms can either request copies of identification documents, use a third party to apply age estimation technology to an account holder's face, or make inferences from data already available such has how long an account has been held.\nAbout 2.5 million Australians are aged between 8 and 15, said the country's eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant, and past estimates suggested 84% of 8- to 12-year-olds held social media accounts. It was not known how many accounts were held across the 10 platforms but Inman Grant said the figure of 4.7 million \"deactivated or restricted\" was encouraging.\n\"We're preventing predatory social media companies from accessing our children,\" Inman Grant said.\nThe 10 biggest companies covered by the ban were compliant with it and had reported removal figures to Australia's regulator on time, the commissioner said. She added that social media companies were expected to shift their efforts from enforcing the ban to preventing children from creating new accounts or otherwise circumventing the prohibition.\nMeta removed 550,000 accounts\nAustralian officials didn't break the figures down by platform. But Meta, which owns Facebook, Instagram and Threads, said this week that by the day after the ban came into effect it had removed nearly 550,000 accounts belonging to users understood to be under 16.\nIn the blog post divulging the figures, Meta criticized the ban and said smaller platforms where the ban doesn't apply might not prioritize safety. The company also noted browsing platforms would still present content to children based on algorithms - a concern that led to the ban's enactment.\nThe law was widely popular among parents and child safety campaigners. Online privacy advocates and some groups representing teenagers opposed it, with the latter citing the support found in online spaces by vulnerable young people or those geographically isolated in Australia's sprawling rural areas.\nSome said they had managed to fool age assessing technologies or were helped by parents or older siblings to circumvent the ban.\nOther countries might follow\nSince Australia began debating the measures in 2024, other countries have considered following suit. Denmark's government is among them, saying in November that it had planned to implement a social media ban for children under 15.\n\"The fact that in spite of some skepticism out there, it's working and being replicated now around the world, is something that is a source of Australian pride,\" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said Friday.\nOpposition lawmakers have suggested that young people have circumvented the ban easily or are migrating to other apps that are less scrutinized than the largest platforms. Inman Grant said Friday that data seen by her office showed a spike in downloads of alternative apps when the ban was enacted but not a spike in usage.\n\"There is no real long-term trends yet that we can say but we're engaging,\" she said.\nMeanwhile, she said, the regulator she heads planned to introduce \"world-leading AI companion and chatbot restrictions in March.\" She didn't disclose further details.", "url": "https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-and-tech/social-media-platforms-removed-47-million-accounts-after-australia-banned-them-for-children", "scraped_at": "2026-01-30T17:41:43.475399"}
{"title": "NASA sends 4 astronauts back to Earth in first medical evacuation", "content": "CAPE CANAVERAL, JANUARY 15\nAn astronaut in need of doctors' care departed the International Space Station with three crewmates on Wednesday in NASA's first medical evacuation.\nThe four returning astronauts - from the U.S., Russia and Japan - are aiming for an early Thursday morning splashdown in the Pacific near San Diego with SpaceX. The decision cuts short their mission by over a month.\n\"Our timing of this departure is unexpected,\" NASA astronaut Zena Cardman said before the return trip, \"but what was not surprising to me was how well this crew came together as a family to help each other and just take care of each other.\"\nOfficials refused to identify the astronaut who needed care last week and would not divulge the health concerns.\nThe ailing astronaut is \"stable, safe and well cared for,\" outgoing space station commander Mike Fincke said earlier this week via social media. \"This was a deliberate decision to allow the right medical evaluations to happen on the ground, where the full range of diagnostic capability exists.\"\nLaunched in August, Cardman, Fincke, Japan's Kimiya Yui and Russia's Oleg Platonov should have remained on the space station until late February. But on Jan. 7, NASA abruptly canceled the next day's spacewalk by Cardman and Fincke and later announced the crew's early return. Officials said the health problem was unrelated to spacewalk preparations or other station operations, but offered no other details, citing medical privacy. They stressed it was not an emergency situation.\nNASA said it would stick to the same entry and splashdown procedures at flight's end, with the usual assortment of medical experts aboard the recovery ship in the Pacific. It was another middle-of-the-night crew return for SpaceX, coming less than 11 hours after undocking from the space station. NASA said it was not yet known how quickly all four would be flown from California to Houston, home to Johnson Space Center and the base for astronauts.\nOne U.S. and two Russian astronauts remain aboard the orbiting lab, just 1 1/2 months into an eight-month mission that began with a Soyuz rocket liftoff from Kazakhstan. NASA and SpaceX are working to move up the launch of a fresh four-person crew from Florida, currently targeted for mid-February.\nComputer modeling predicted a medical evacuation from the space station every three years, but NASA hasn't had one in its 65 years of human spaceflight. The Russians have not been as fortunate. In 1985, Soviet cosmonaut Vladimir Vasyutin came down with a serious infection or related illness aboard his country's Salyut 7 space station, prompting an early return. A few other Soviet cosmonauts encountered less serious health issues that shortened their flights.\nIt was the first spaceflight for Cardman, 38, biologist and polar explorer who missed out on spacewalking, as well as Platonov, 39, a former fighter pilot with the Russian air force who had to wait a few extra years to get to space because of an undisclosed health issue. Cardman should have launched last year but was bumped to make room on the way down for NASA's Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who were stuck nearly a year at the space station because of Boeing's capsule problems.\nFincke, 58, a retired Air Force colonel, and Yui, 55, a retired fighter pilot with the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, were repeat space fliers. Finke has spent 1 1/2 years in orbit over four missions and conducted nine spacewalks on previous flights, making him one of NASA's top performers. Last week, Yui celebrated his 300th day in space over two station stays, sharing stunning views of Earth, including Japan's Mount Fuji and breathtaking auroras.\n\"I want to burn it firmly into my eyes, and even more so, into my heart,\" Yui said on the social platform X. \"Soon, I too will become one of those small lights on the ground.\"\nNASA officials had said it was riskier to leave the astronaut in space without proper medical attention for another month than to temporarily reduce the size of the space station crew by more than half. Until SpaceX delivers another crew, NASA said it will have to stand down from any routine or even emergency spacewalks, a two-person job requiring backup help from crew inside the orbiting complex.\nThe medical evacuation was the first major decision by NASA's new administrator Jared Isaacman. The billionaire founder of a payment processing company and two-time space flier assumed the agency's top job in December.\n\"The health and the well-being of our astronauts is always and will be our highest priority,\" Isaacman said in announcing the decision last week.", "url": "https://thehimalayantimes.com/science-and-tech/nasa-sends-4-astronauts-back-to-earth-in-first-medical-evacuation", "scraped_at": "2026-01-30T17:41:46.224983"}
{"title": "Cycling to combat cancer", "content": "Harka Lama felt as though his life was ending when he was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2020. The treatment was a hard-won battle, with two surgeries and 27 rounds of chemotherapy before he went into remission in 2022.\nAs harrowing as his journey was, he did not have to worry much about covering the cost of his treatment, thanks to friends and well-wishers, particularly those overseas, who extended financial support. Lama’s fight against cancer was less painful because of this support.\nHowever, throughout his grueling treatment, he could not help but think of those who might not have the support he got.\n“I had help from friends, but I saw many cancer patients who could not even afford to be admitted to hospital for treatment,” says Lama. “I had to do something to help.”\nAn avid cyclist, Lama had met Bikash Parajuli, an orthopaedist at Dhulikhel Hospital, in 2017 when he participated in the Yak Attack high-altitude mountain bike race in which Parajuli was a medic. When Lama was diagnosed with cancer, Parajuli encouraged him to go for treatment at Dhulikhel.\nWhile brainstorming about ways to raise funds for patients in need, Lama was inspired by Yak Attack to raise money through cross country bicycling. He teamed up with Dhulikhel Hospital and the Cycle Culture Community (CCC), planning to cycle east to west along Nepal’s foothills to raise funds.\nFive years later this month, bicyclists began their fundraising tour from Panchthar’s Chiwabanjyang in eastern Nepal to Baitadi’s Jhulaghat in the west, cycling 1,800km across Nepal from 1-27 January.\nLama and Parajuli, along with Kabita Chitrakar, Bhairaja Maharjan, and Keshav KC cycled the full route. Along the way, more than 50 people had joined with their bicycles for parts of the trail.\nLead rider Kabita Chitrakar is currently being treated for breast cancer that was diagnosed four years ago after she had lost both her mother and sister to the disease.\nCYCLING, A SAVIOUR\n“It was doubly painful to be battling the disease by myself after losing them,” says Chitrakar who found out during a radiation therapy session that the cancer had spread to her lungs and the doctor gave her six months to live. “I fell into a depressive spiral. I could not eat or sleep.”\nHer friends and family encouraged her to take up cycling to keep her spirits up. Her nephew brought her a bicycle with a modified seat so that she could ride comfortably. In time, what had started as a hobby became a passion.\n“As I rode through mountains and forests, I began to enjoy cycling, and my heart began to feel lighter. I was no longer sad, cycling changed my whole perspective towards life,” she told us, back in Kathmandu. She has gone through eight rounds of chemotherapy and has heard from other women how much her spirit inspired them, too.\n“My family was my pillar through my treatment, encouraging me to fight this disease and live my life to the fullest,” she says. “I want to encourage other women to who are going through the same thing that I did.”\nAs Lama and Chitrakar cycled up and down mountain trails, the team did not just raise funds, they also held awareness programs in 14 schools across 11 districts about cancers, mobilising local mother’s groups.\n“We encouraged young girls and women to be aware about the risks of breast and cervical cancer, and go for screening and mammography,” says gynecologist Suman Raj Tamrakar, a member of the cycling team. “We met with over 1,700 young girls and women during our journey.”\nThe cycling team has raised Rs2.3 million, and it will be handed over to Dhulikhel Hospital, which has committed to matching the amount raised to cover the cost of treatment for poorer patients.\nSays Lama: “I am beyond happy to have completed this journey. But even happier that we raised all that money for the cause.”", "url": "https://nepalitimes.com//here-now/cycling-to-combat-cancer", "scraped_at": "2026-01-30T17:58:54.185007"}
